webdriver-wrapper
====================

webdriver-wrapper allows to create WebDriver extensions following Decorator design pattern; it also contains several ready-to-use extensions: a wrapper that highlights elements before an action, a wrapper that handles unhandled alerts, a wrapper that handles "stale" elements and attempts to find them again and perform the action on the "restored" element
